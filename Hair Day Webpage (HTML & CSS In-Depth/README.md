How to approach and plan a web page layout
1. Visual Layout
    a. The web page should have the company logo at the top of the page with a navigation menu underneath. 
    b. The main content of the page should be below the navigation menu. c. At the bottom of the page is the footer. 
    d. The navigation menu requires four links to be laid out horizontally. One link must be to the homepage you are developing depending on the client persona you've chosen. The other links can be to product pages, contact forms or company information pages.
    e. The main content should feature a large banner that links to the client's current promotional offer below the promotional banner. There are three columns. Each column should contain an image followed by a heading and some text.
    f. Depending on the client you choose, these can contain offerings or information about the client. 
    g. The footer is split into two columns. The left column will contain a small version of the client logo and the right column will contain copyright text.
2. HTML & CSS Structure
    a. It's important to semantically structure your HTML document so search engines and accessibility software can understand the semantics of the web page.
    b. Use the header element for the logo, the nav element for the navigation, the main element for the main content and the footer element for the footer of the page.
    c. Plan your grid layout for the main content and footer for these parts of the web page. You can use either a CSS grid or a flex box layout.
    d. It's important to plan your CSS rules for the different sized columns that are required. 
    e. You'll need a full width column and 3 1/3 columns for the main content. Consider splitting the content into two rows/
    f. Two half-width columns for the footer.
    g. Plan your units of measurement when defining your CSS rules and properties. It will be easier to maintain and debug your CSS if your units are consistent throughout the code. 
    h. First you consider the visual layout, then the html and CSS structure for the layout, followed by the semantic structure and then the grid layout.
